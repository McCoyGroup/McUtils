# <a id="McUtils.Numputils.SetOps.split_by_regions">split_by_regions</a>

Splits an array up by edges defined by regions.
    Operates in 1D but can take compound dtypes using lexicographic
    ordering.
    In that case it is on the user to ensure that lex ordering is what is desired.

```python
split_by_regions(ar, regions, sortings=None, return_indices=False): 
```

- `ar`: `Any`
    >No description...
- `regions`: `Any`
    >No description...
- `sortings`: `Any`
    >No description...
- `:returns`: `_`
    >No description...
