## RegexPattern

A `RegexPattern` is a higher-level interface to work with the [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) (regex) string pattern matching language.
Python provides support for regular expressions through the [`re`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html) module.
Being comfortable with regex is not a requirement for working with `RegexPattern` but will help explain some of the more confusing design decisions.

There are a bunch of different `RegexPattern` instances that cover different cases, e.g.

* `Word`: matches a string of characters that are generally considered _text_
* `PositiveInteger`: matches a string of characters that are only _digits_
* `Integer`: a `PositiveInteger` with and optional sign
* `Number`: matches `Integer.PositiveInteger`
* `VariableName`: matches a string of digits or text as the first character is a letter
* `Optional`: represents an _optional_ pattern to match

### Capturing/Named

When matching pieces of text it is also important to specify which pieces of text we would like to actually get back out.
For this there are two main `RegexPattern` instances.
The simplest one is `Capturing`.
This just specifies that we would like to capture a piece of text.
There is a slightly more sophisticated instance called `Named` which allows us to attach a _name_ to a group.
