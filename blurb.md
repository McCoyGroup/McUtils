This is the reference documentation for the [`McUtils`](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/McUtils) package, 
written starting in 2018 by the McCoy group at the University of Washington.

The package is split into a many subsections focussed particularly on making data importable and handling complicated numerical workflows.

You can read more about the functionality provided in the [API reference](McUtils).
The reference is automatically generated by the [Peeves](https://github.com/McCoyGroup/Peeves) testing/documentation helper package.

We have also set up a test environment on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
